## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run

1.  Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.

    python sticky_note.pyw
    ```

### Building an Executable (Optional)

To convert the application into a standalone `.exe` file, you can use `pyinstaller`:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noconsole sticky_note.pyw
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the final executable file.
